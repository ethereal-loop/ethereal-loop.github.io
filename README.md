# Ethereal Loop
Ethereal Loop is a website to display cool abstract animations, that are automatically generated by an AI-based animation generator (called Ethereal-gen).

Its a project I worked on for a year, and now its open source

Ethereal have 3 components:
1. Ethereal Gen : automatic generator for animations
2. Ethereal Data: store cool animations, mostly from that generator
3. Ethereal Loop (this repo): a website to display all of those.

## how the site works
